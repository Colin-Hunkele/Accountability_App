# Accountability App

## Description

This project was created as my final project for COSC-355 Mobile Computing. Accountability can be a big problem for student-athletes.
Many athletes will blow off a day of practice or miss a lift and not make up that missed day. As a student-athlete, I understand this urge to not come to practice very well. 
With this app, coaches would be able to send out objectives for their athletes to complete. The objective would have a set date, time, and place that it would need to be completed. 
Athletes could also set reminders to do these objectives. When an athlete completes an objective, they should mark it as “done” in the app. 
This will send a notification to their coach that contains a message that says they did the workout as well as their location. 
For example, if a coach were to give a pool workout to an injured athlete and their athlete blew it off, their coach would know that they marked the workout as complete, without actually making the effort to go to the pool and could punish them accordingly. 
The same applies to a lifting session, the coach could check to see if their athlete was at a gym when they marked their task as complete. 
For runners, I am considering Strava integration, which would allow coaches to see the distance and times of their runners.


### Personas
Kyle is a runner that recently got injured and his coach has assigned him workouts through the accountability app. These workouts include several swim workouts and a few recovery lifts.
Kyle wants to show his coach that he is committed to getting better and that he wants to be the best he can be. SO using the app he tracks all of the workouts that he does and he is able to recover quickly.

Ian is a recently injured football player. His coach assigns him recovery wokrouts, however, Ian blows these off as he feels he should recover by taking time off.
His coach begins to take notice that Ian has not recovered and assigns him the workouts through the app to see if he actually does them. Now that his coach
is monitoring him, Ian now attends all of his recovery sessions

Charles is a soccer player who does not show up to practice or to team lift due to having classes. He says that he is doing theses practices and lifts on his own but his coach notices that he is very out of shape.
After assigning Charles workouts through the app, due to the app tracking his location, his coach noticed that he would mark practices as "complete" from his room, and would not even attempt to complete lifts.
Thanks to the app, Charles is punished accordingly.

#### Interface
I'm going to attempt to make this app be somewhat similar to the default reminder app that is provided to IPhone users.

Coaches could enter in activities and send them out to their athletes.
Athletes would then receive a notification and would have a list of workouts that they need to complete

##### Metrics
When an athlete completes an activity, a coach could look and mark the activity as "valid", meaning that the activity was done at the proper location.
The app could track the number of "valid" activities that an athlete completes. Coaches could see this number, and even reward athletes based on their number of "valid" activities.
The app could also track the number of activities an athlete missed or did not complete properly. Coaches could see this number as well.

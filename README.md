# Accountability App

## Descirption

This project was created as my final project for COSC-355 Mobile Computing. Accountability can be a big problem for student-athletes.
Many athletes will blow off a day of practice or miss a lift and not make up that missed day. As a student-athlete, I understand this urge to not come to practice very well. 
With this app, coaches would be able to send out objectives for their athletes to complete. The objective would have a set date, time, and place that it would need to be completed. 
Athletes could also set reminders to do these objectives. When an athlete completes an objective, they should mark it as “done” in the app. 
This will send a notification to their coach that contains a message that says they did the workout as well as their location. 
For example, if a coach were to give a pool workout to an injured athlete and their athlete blew it off, their coach would know that they marked the workout as complete, without actually making the effort to go to the pool and could punish them accordingly. 
The same applies to a lifting session, the coach could check to see if their athlete was at a gym when they marked their task as complete. 
For runners, I am considering Strava integration, which would allow coaches to see the distance and times of their runners.
